k8temp - AMD K8 thermal diode reader
====================================

Synopsis
--------
k8temp displays readings from the on-die thermal diodes found in most
AMD K8 processors, including Athlon 64's and Opterons.

As of 0.4.0, k8temp can also produce values from AMD K10's, including
Barcelona and Phenom.  This support is experimental, and is unlikely to
report realistic values at this time.


=======
WARNING
=======
Since this pokes at PCI registers, it has the potential to make your system
crash, reboot, catch fire, and frame you for conspiracy to murder heads of state.

k8temp has caused at least one of these things to happen during development.


Installation
------------
If you're on FreeBSD, consider using the port at sysutils/k8temp.

Otherwise, just:

  make
  make install

The Makefile should detect any flags your OS needs.

If you want to try it on a system without bsd.prog.mk:

  cc -o k8temp k8temp.c k8temp_devpci.c

OpenBSD users (who have USER_PCI configured kernels) may want:

  cc -DWITHOUT_PCIOCGETCONF -o k8temp k8temp.c k8temp_devpci.c

NetBSD users can try:

  cc -DWITH_LIBPCI -o k8temp k8temp.c k8temp_libpci.c

But note this has only been build tested (on FreeBSD and NetBSD/Sparc...)

DragonFlyBSD should Just Work(tm), since it has an identical /dev/pci API
to FreeBSD.

Let me know if you get it working on systems other than FreeBSD 6 or 7.

Yes, some AMD64's allegedly have two sensors per core.
