k8temp - AMD K8 thermal diode reader
====================================

Synopsis
--------
k8temp displays readings from the on-die thermal diodes found in most
AMD K8 processors, including AMD64's and Opterons.

Please see the warning below.


Example
-------
-% sudo k8temp
CPU 0 Core 0 Sensor 0: 37c
CPU 0 Core 0 Sensor 1: 36c
CPU 0 Core 1 Sensor 0: 36c
CPU 0 Core 1 Sensor 1: 36c
CPU 1 Core 0 Sensor 0: 32c
CPU 1 Core 0 Sensor 1: 32c
CPU 1 Core 1 Sensor 0: 32c
CPU 1 Core 1 Sensor 1: 32c

Yes, AMD64's allegedly have two sensors per core.


Installation
------------
make

Put k8temp and k8temp.8 wherever.

WARNING
=======
Since this pokes at /dev/pci, it has the potential to make your system crash,
reboot, catch fire, and frame you for conspiracy to murder heads of state.

Out of 5 test machines, I've only managed to kill one of them, and the code
responsible for that has been disabled (try building with -DCOUNT_CORES if you
feel lucky and have single core CPUs).  Still, I don't recommend trying it on
production systems you can't afford to die.
