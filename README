k8temp - AMD K8 thermal diode reader
====================================

Synopsis
--------
k8temp displays readings from the on-die thermal diodes found in most
AMD K8 processors, including Athlon 64's and Opterons.

Please see the warning below.


Example
-------
-% sudo k8temp
CPU 0 Core 0 Sensor 0: 48c
CPU 0 Core 1 Sensor 0: 50c
CPU 1 Core 0 Sensor 0: 49c
CPU 1 Core 1 Sensor 0: 47c

Yes, some AMD64's allegedly have two sensors per core.


Installation
------------
make

Put k8temp and k8temp.8 wherever.

WARNING
=======
Since this pokes at /dev/pci, it has the potential to make your system crash,
reboot, catch fire, and frame you for conspiracy to murder heads of state.

Out of 5 test machines, I've only managed to kill one of them, and the code
responsible for that has been removed.  Still, I don't recommend trying it on
production systems you can't afford to die.
