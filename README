k8temp - AMD K8 thermal diode reader
====================================

Synopsis
--------
k8temp displays readings from the on-die thermal diodes found in most
AMD K8 processors, including Athlon 64's and Opterons.

Please see the warning below, and remember to check the manpage.


Examples
--------
-% sudo k8temp
CPU 0 Core 0 Sensor 0: 35c
CPU 0 Core 1 Sensor 0: 36c
CPU 1 Core 0 Sensor 0: 33c
CPU 1 Core 1 Sensor 0: 32c

Yes, some AMD64's allegedly have two sensors per core.

-% sudo k8temp -d
CPUID: Vendor: AuthenticAMD, Id=0x20f12 Model=2 Family=1 Stepping=15
Advanced Power Management=0xf
   Temperature sensor: Yes
 Frequency ID control: Yes
   Voltage ID control: Yes
    THERMTRIP support: Yes
   HW Thermal control: No
   SW Thermal control: No
   100MHz multipliers: No

Thermtrip=0x0d540524 (CurTmp=0x54 (35c) TjOffset=0x0d DiodeOffset=0x05 (6c))
CPU 0 Core 0 Sensor 0: 35c
Thermtrip=0x0d560520 (CurTmp=0x56 (37c) TjOffset=0x0d DiodeOffset=0x05 (6c))
CPU 0 Core 1 Sensor 0: 37c
Probe device: 0:25:3
Thermtrip=0x0f520224 (CurTmp=0x52 (33c) TjOffset=0x0f DiodeOffset=0x02 (9c))
CPU 1 Core 0 Sensor 0: 33c
Thermtrip=0x0f520220 (CurTmp=0x52 (33c) TjOffset=0x0f DiodeOffset=0x02 (9c))
CPU 1 Core 1 Sensor 0: 33c


Installation
------------
Preferably, use the FreeBSD port, sysutils/k8temp.

Otherwise, just:

  make
  make install

If you want to try it on a system without bsd.prog.mk:

  cc -o k8temp k8temp.c k8temp_devpci.c

OpenBSD users may want:

  cc -DWITHOUT_PCIOCGETCONF -o k8temp k8temp.c k8temp_devpci.c

NetBSD users can try:

  cc -DWITH_LIBPCI -o k8temp k8temp.c k8temp_libpci.c

But it almost certainly won't work, since I haven't even compile tested it.
Feel free to fix it.

Let me know if you get it working on systems other than FreeBSD 6/amd64.

=======
WARNING
=======
Since this pokes at PCI registers, it has the potential to make your system
crash, reboot, catch fire, and frame you for conspiracy to murder heads of state.

k8temp has caused at least one of these things to happen during development.
